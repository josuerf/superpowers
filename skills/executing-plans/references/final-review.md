# The Code-Reviewer Path of the Final Review

Part of superpowers-prepared:executing-plans. The project does not opt into
carrasco, so a fresh code-reviewer is this run's whole-branch review. Paths
in commands are relative to the executing-plans skill directory.

Run `bash ../subagent-driven-development/scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD`
(MERGE_BASE = the commit the branch started from, e.g.
`git merge-base main HEAD`) and review from the file it prints.

**With a subagent tool:** dispatch the reviewer on the most capable
available model — the whole-branch review is a judgment task — using
superpowers-prepared:requesting-code-review's
[code-reviewer.md](../../requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md), with the
package path, the plan and spec paths, the plan's Review Focus section
verbatim if it has one (the input classes and failure modes the plan's
tests do not exercise — the reviewer checks each deliberately), and a
pointer to the ledger's `Ruling:` lines so it can weigh the calls you
made. Specify the model
explicitly; an omitted model inherits the session's, which may not be the
most capable. This is the one fresh context the whole run buys. Do not
skip it, and do not replace it with your own read of the diff.

**Without a subagent tool:** read code-reviewer.md and perform that review
yourself against the package, as a separate pass after the last task's
ledger line. Write `Final review: self-review (no subagent tool)` to the
ledger, and say so in your final message: a self-review by the author is
weaker than a fresh reviewer, and your human partner decides whether that
is enough before merge.

Sort the findings before you act on any of them. The reviewer's severity
labels are advice; the gate is yours. Its "Declined to judge" list is
yours too: every line there is a ruling you make and ledger, exactly like
a plan conflict — `Final: Ruling: <behavior the reviewer set aside> —
<what a reasonable person using this software gets, and why that stands
or why it is now a finding> — <cost if wrong>`. Re-grade first, by effect: the
spec is a vision document, and a finding's grade is what a reasonable
person using this software gets if it ships, not whether the spec names
the input that triggers it — a reviewer who set a finding at Minor
because the spec was silent has graded the spec, not the effect. Then:

- **Critical and Important** enter the fix pass.
- **Minor** goes to the ledger as `Final: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`
  and to your final message under "Deferred minors". Minors never enter
  the fix pass, and never become rulings — a ruling is a decision about a
  conflict, not a note that you declined a polish suggestion.

Fix the Critical and Important findings yourself — you are the
implementer here — in ONE pass. Each fix is verified by TDD, not by a
second reviewer: write the test that reproduces the finding, watch it
fail, make it pass, then run the whole suite. Record each in the ledger as
`Final: fixed <finding> — <test name> RED→GREEN, suite <N>/<N>`. A fix
without a test that failed first is not verified; a suite that is not
green after the pass means the pass is not over. Do not dispatch a
re-review: it would re-read a diff whose covering tests already answer
"addressed" and whose suite run already answers "broke nothing".

A finding you decide not to fix is a ruling — `Final: Ruling: <finding> —
<why the code stands> — <cost if wrong>` — and reaches your human partner
in the rulings list. There is no second fix pass.
